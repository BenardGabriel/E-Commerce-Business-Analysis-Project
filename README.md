# E-Commerce-Business-Analysis-Project

## Project Overview
This Power BI dashboard presents a detailed, end-to-end analysis of an e-commerce business, focusing on essential performance metrics that drive growth and efficiency. It provides a data-rich view of the company’s operations, aimed at uncovering trends, identifying gaps, and supporting strategic decisions.
The dashboard explores a range of critical areas, starting with overall business performance, including revenue trends and growth metrics. It dives into customer demographics, analyzing segments by age, gender, marital status, and education level to better understand customer behavior and churn patterns.

Additionally, it visualizes revenue contributions from products and categories, helping highlight top-performing items and identify areas for potential expansion or adjustment. The dashboard also examines the effectiveness of marketing efforts, revealing how campaigns influence revenue over time and across product lines.
A key component of the analysis includes assessing the performance of various sales channels—such as online, retail, mobile, and marketplace—offering insights into which platforms are most effective in generating revenue. It also monitors inventory flow, allowing for better stock management and fulfillment efficiency.
Beyond financials and marketing, the dashboard sheds light on operational performance, spotting patterns and performance shifts over time. This multi-dimensional view empowers stakeholders to make informed, data-driven decisions across departments.
Ultimately, the dashboard serves as a strategic tool to support decision-makers, uncover hidden opportunities, and optimize business operations across the entire value chain. Its dynamic visuals and interactive elements make it not only informative but also easy to navigate and explore.

## Problem Statement
J & J is a retail business operating in a competitive and fast-paced market. Although the company has recorded consistent revenue and growth across multiple states and sales channels, it continues to face challenges in achieving sustained profitability, optimizing marketing efforts, and improving operational efficiency. The business recognizes the need for a data-driven approach to uncover hidden patterns, reduce inefficiencies, and maximize return on investment.

To guide strategic decision-making, the business seeks to explore the following critical questions:

#### **Product Performance**

* Which product categories and individual products are driving the most revenue?
* Which products are underperforming, and what factors may be contributing to low sales or high return rates?
* How can inventory usage be better aligned with actual customer demand?

#### **Customer Behavior and Retention**

* Which customer segments contribute most to revenue, and which segments are at risk of churn?
* What patterns exist in product returns that may indicate dissatisfaction or delivery issues?
* How can customer retention be improved, particularly for high-value segments?

#### **Marketing Strategy and Efficiency**

* Which marketing campaign types are generating the most clicks and conversions?
* What is the current return on advertising spend (ROAS), and how can it be improved?
* How effective are individual marketing channels in driving revenue compared to their costs?
* What strategies can increase conversion rates and reduce customer acquisition costs?

#### **Sales Channel Optimization**

* Which sales channels yield the highest revenue and best customer engagement?
* How balanced is the distribution of revenue across online, retail, mobile, and other channels?
* Are there emerging or underutilized channels with potential for growth?

#### **Geographic Performance**

* Which regions and states are top-performing in terms of revenue, conversions, and delivery efficiency?
* Where are the gaps in market coverage, and which regions show potential for expansion or improved performance?
* How do return rates and delivery issues vary by state?

#### **Operational Improvement**

* How efficient are current delivery operations, and where are the key bottlenecks?
* What is the relationship between product return rates and operational costs?
* How can inventory and logistics be optimized to reduce waste and increase efficiency?

By answering these questions, J & J aims to gain actionable insights that will enable smarter business decisions, improve customer satisfaction, and drive long-term growth.
