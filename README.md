# E-Commerce-Business-Analysis-Project

## Project Overview
This Power BI dashboard presents a detailed, end-to-end analysis of an e-commerce business, focusing on essential performance metrics that drive growth and efficiency. It provides a data-rich view of the company’s operations, aimed at uncovering trends, identifying gaps, and supporting strategic decisions.
The dashboard explores a range of critical areas, starting with overall business performance, including revenue trends and growth metrics. It dives into customer demographics, analyzing segments by age, gender, marital status, and education level to better understand customer behavior and churn patterns.

Additionally, it visualizes revenue contributions from products and categories, helping highlight top-performing items and identify areas for potential expansion or adjustment. The dashboard also examines the effectiveness of marketing efforts, revealing how campaigns influence revenue over time and across product lines.
A key component of the analysis includes assessing the performance of various sales channels—such as online, retail, mobile, and marketplace—offering insights into which platforms are most effective in generating revenue. It also monitors inventory flow, allowing for better stock management and fulfillment efficiency.
Beyond financials and marketing, the dashboard sheds light on operational performance, spotting patterns and performance shifts over time. This multi-dimensional view empowers stakeholders to make informed, data-driven decisions across departments.
Ultimately, the dashboard serves as a strategic tool to support decision-makers, uncover hidden opportunities, and optimize business operations across the entire value chain. Its dynamic visuals and interactive elements make it not only informative but also easy to navigate and explore.
